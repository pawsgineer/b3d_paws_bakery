## I'm not a developer

You can still make a big difference:

- Submit Bug Reports and Feature Requests
- Review existing [issues][gh-issues] and [Q&A][gh-disc-q-a] to help others
- Wanna write the docs or article? ðŸ˜¢
- A bunch of spelling errors hidden here and there. Fixing it could be as
  simple as finding and editing it right here using GitHub interface!
