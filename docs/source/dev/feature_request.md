# Requesting a Feature

1. **Check existing Ideas**

   Browse the [ideas][gh-disc-ideas] to see if someone has already
   suggested the feature.

2. **Upvote & Add Context**

   If you find a similar request, please upvote it and consider enriching it
   with additional context:

   - A detailed description
   - Screenshots
   - Link to relevant video (with timecode) or article

3. **Make sure we're on the same page**

   The developer may not be aware of the pipeline you're using or trying to
   implement, no matter how obvious it seems to you.

   To improve our communication, provide context, use cases and examples.
