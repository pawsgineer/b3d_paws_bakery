# Preferences

## Scene

All settings available in the **üç∞PAWSBKR** **N-Panel**, including defined
**Texture Sets**, are applied and stored in the Scene properties.

:::{warning}
This means that if you delete a Scene that has Texture Sets and other settings
added to it, you will loose all those settings.
