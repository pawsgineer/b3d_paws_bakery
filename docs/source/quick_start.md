# Get Started

## Installation

Available on [Blender Extensions] and [GitHub Releases].

[Blender Extensions]: https://extensions.blender.org/add-ons/paws-bakery
[GitHub Releases]: https://github.com/pawsgineer/b3d_paws_bakery/releases

### Supported versions

Developed and tested for Blender 4.2+.

## Before you start

The add-on automates material setup for texture baking and provides batch baking
workflow for processing a set of textures and objects at once.

To better understand what you can achieve, you may need to familiarize yourself
with the baking process in vanilla Blender.

Most controls appear in the 3D Viewport **üç∞PAWSBKR** **N-Panel**.

## Operation modes

The add-on operates in two modes.

(quick-start-simple-mode)=
### Simple

**Simple Mode** allows you to bake selected in 3D Viewport objects to a single image.

This mode is useful for one-time operations and quick testing.

:::{note}
Currently baking only works with Principled BSDF Shader.
Doesn't suit your needs? Let me know!

(quick-start-texture-set-mode)=
### Texture Set

**Texture Set** mode allows you to specify set of objects and texture types to bake.

This mode is useful for repetitive operations or batch baking a set of objects and
textures for export or intermediate bakes.

In this section you can manage **Texture Sets**, their associated settings, and
run bake of all textures enabled for the **Texture Set**.

#### Settings

**Name**
: Name of **Texture Set**

**Output Mode**
: **Single Texture (Atlas)**
  : Bake all the objects to a single atlas texture.

: **Per-Object**
  : Create a separate image for every object in the list.

**Create Materials**
: See [](./automatic_material_creation.md)

#### Objects

In this section you can manage objects linked to the active **Texture Set**.

To add objects to the list, select them in the 3D Viewport and click the `+` button.

You can uncheck a checkbox in the list to temporarily disable object baking.
